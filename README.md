# Mewps
Mewps is a robot aware of its environment using various sensors that include a camera, an ultrasonic distance sensor, an accelerometer and microphones.
It stands on four wheels out of which the front two are powered by DC motors to provide mobility. The main computer is a Rasberry Pi 3 Model B that uses
an Arduino for auxilliary functions such as reading sensor data and adjusting motor speed.

The robot is currently intended to be a collaborative effort from my friends and myself. Credits list is will be available soon.
